Which methods in your code are called?

The `HandleRequest` method is being used.

What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?



How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request? If no values got changed, explain why.
By values, we mean specific Strings, ints, URIs, and so on. "abc" is a value, 456 is a value, new URI("http://...") is a value, and so on.)

 The argument for this method is url. The string s is an empty string at the beginning. It then increments throught the handleequest function. The row variable keeps track of the row number of the last row.
