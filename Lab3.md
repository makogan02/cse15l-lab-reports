A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)




An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

```ruby
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace1() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
```

The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)



The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)
