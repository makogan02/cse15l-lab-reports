# Part 1 #

* A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

```ruby
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace2() {
	int[] input2 = {3,4,5 };
	ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
	assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5,4,3 }, input2);
}


```


* An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)

```ruby
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace1() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```

* The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)

* The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

Before
```ruby
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```

After
```ruby
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }


```


I ran both tests again(the one that induces a failure-inducing input and the one that doesn't) and they both succeeded

* Briefly describe why the fix addresses the issue

The first issue in the code was that we switched the first half of the list with the second part and then kept going. Instead, we need to stop after we have reacehd the center of the list. If there are odd number of elements the code will still work since the middle element doesn't need to be switched with itself. The second problem with the code was that it overwrites the elements instead of replacing them. To fix that we store the value of the element before overwriting it.






# Part 2 #

## researching the commands ##
For this part, I asked chat gpt: "What are some command-line options for grep with examples". Here is the output that I used of what he gave me. 

```ruby
Case-Insensitive Search (-i):
This option makes the search case-insensitive.
grep -i "pattern" file.txt

Display Line Numbers (-n):
This option shows the line numbers of matching lines.
grep -n "pattern" file.txt

Search for Whole Words (-w):
This option only matches whole words, not substrings.
grep -w "word" file.txt

Count Matching Lines (-c):
This option displays the count of matching lines instead of the lines themselves.
grep -c "pattern" file.txt
```


## Applying the commands with examples ##

* The first command-line is -i. This makes grep case insensitive as grep at default is case sensitive. Chatgpt states: "Case-Insensitive Search (-i): This option makes the search case-insensitive. grep -i "pattern" file.txt". Here is grep -i applied to two files:


```ruby
grep -i "hard" chapter-1.txt
    The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:23, a hijacker said, "Pull it down! Pull it down!"The hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them. The airplane headed down; the control wheel was turned hard to the right. The airplane rolled onto its back, and one of the hijackers began shouting "Allah is the greatest. Allah is the greatest." With the sounds of the passenger counterattack continuing, the aircraft plowed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 580 miles per hour, about 20 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C.
    At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington. Indeed, it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before 9:37, when the Pentagon was struck.

We can see from this example that when we used -i, it printed all the lines that contained "hard" and "early" regardless of capital letters. This can be useful if you don't care about capitalization and just want to print the lines that contain the pattern.

* The second command-line is -n. It displays the line numbers that match the string as well as the lines themselves. Chatgpt states: "Display Line Numbers (-n):
This option shows the line numbers of matching lines. grep -n "pattern" file.txt". Here is grep -n applied for two files.

As we can see the command printed the line number that contain the pattern "done". This is very useful as the lines might be long and we don't want to see the contents of the entire line, only the line number.

* The third command-line is -w. This makes grep only return words that match the string provided. This means that unless the line has the string as a whole word, it will not return the line.
Chatgpt states: "Search for Whole Words (-w): This option only matches whole words, not substrings. grep -w "word" file.txt".

As we can see, grep returned only the lines that contained the word do. So for example if the line contained done and not do, the line will not be part of the output. This is very useful because sometimes we want to find a specific word and not just a string pattern.


* The last command-line is -c which displays the count of matching lines. Chatgpt states: "Count Matching Lines (-c): This option displays the count of matching lines instead of the lines themselves.

As we can see, grep returns the number of times the string pattern has appeared in the text files. This is also very useful because sometimes we only care about the number of times the pattern appeared and we don't want to see on which specific line the pattern appeared or the contents of the line on which the pattern appeared.
